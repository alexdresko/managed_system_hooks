		<Class>
			<summary>
				This class is the abstract base class for all system hook classes.
			</summary>
			<remarks>
				<para>
					To use this class you typically create a derived type which is a
					particular type of hook. Then simply implement the <c>HookCallback</c>
					method. This method will be called whenever an event is caught
					by the base class. For example, we have created the 
					<see cref="MouseHook" /> and <see cref="KeyboardHook" /> classes 
					following this prescription. 
				</para>
				<para>
					Note that each type of hook class is expected to exist as a singleton.
