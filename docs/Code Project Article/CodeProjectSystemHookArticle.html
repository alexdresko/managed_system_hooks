		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<P>This article discusses the use of <STRONG>global</STRONG>
		system hooks in .NET applications. A reusable class library is developed along 
		the way.
		<P>You may have noticed other articles on using system hooks with PInvoke on Code 
			Project or other publications (see background section below). This article is 
			similar to those but there is a significant difference. This article is covers 
			using global system hooks in .NET whereas the other articles cover local system 
			hooks. The ideas are similar but the implementation is different.
			<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
		In case you are not familiar with the concept of system hooks in Windows, let 
		me state a few brief descriptions:
		<P><EM>A <U>system hook</U> allows you to insert a callback function which intercepts 
				certain windows messages (e.g. mouse related messages).</EM>
		<P><EM>A <U>local system hook</U> is a system hook that is called only when the 
				specified messages are processed by a single thread.</EM>
		<P><EM>A <U>global system hook</U> is a system hook that is called when the specified 
				messages are processed by any application on the entire system.</EM>
		<P>
		There are several good articles which introduce the concept of system hooks. 
		Rather than rehashing the introductory information here I'll simply refer 
		readers to those articles for background information on system hooks. If you're 
		familiar with the concept of system hooks, then you should be able to get 
		everything you need from this article.

			&nbsp; &nbsp; <A href="http://www.thecodeproject.com/csharp/NetWin32Hooks.asp">Using 
				Hooks from C#</A> by Don Kackman<BR>
		<P>What we are going to cover in this article is extending this information to 
			create a global system hook which is usable in .NET classes. We will develop a 
			class library in C# and a DLL in unmanaged C++ which together will accomplish 
			this goal.
			<h2>Using the code</h2>
		<p>Before we dig into developing this library, let's take a quick look at where we 
			are headed. In this article we will develop a class library that installs <STRONG>global</STRONG>
			system hooks and exposes the events processed by the hook as a .NET event of 
			our hook class. To illustrate the usage of the system hook classes, we will 
			create a mouse event hook and keyboard event hook in a Windows Forms application written in C#.</p>
		<P>The class library can be used to create any type of system hook. There are two 
			that come pre-built: <code>MouseHook</code> and <code>KeyboardHook</code>. We
			have also included specialized versions of these classes called <code>MouseHookExt</code> 
			and <code>KeyboardHookExt</code> respectively.
			Following the model set by those classes you can easily build system hooks for 
			any of the 15 hook event types in the Win32 API. Also, the entire class library 
			comes with a compiled HTML help file which documents the classes. Be sure to 
			look at this help file if you decide to use this library in your applications.</P>
		<P>The usage and lifecycle of the <code>MouseHook</code> class is quite simple. 
			First we create an instance of <code>MouseHook</code> class. We must pass the 
			application's instance pointer to the constructor.</P>
		<pre>   IntPtr appInstance = GetApplicationInstance();
   mouseHook = new MouseHook(appInstance); // mouseHook is a member variable</pre>
		<P>Next, we wire up the <code>MouseEvent</code> event to a class level method.</P>
		<pre>    mouseHook.MouseEvent += new MouseHook.MouseEventHandler(mouseHook_MouseEvent);

    // ...

    private void mouseHook_MouseEvent(MouseEvents mEvent, int x, int y)
    {
        string msg = string.Format("Mouse event: {0}: ({1},{2}).", mEvent.ToString(), x, y);
        AddText(msg); // Adds the message to the text box.
    }</pre>
		<P>To start receiving mouse events, simply install the hook.</P>
		<pre>    mouseHook.InstallHook();</pre>
		<p>To stop receiving events simply uninstall the hook.</p>
		<pre>    mouseHook.UninstallHook();</pre>
		<p>You can also call <code>Dispose</code> which will uninstall the hook as well.</p>
		<P>It is critically important that you uninstall the hook when your application 
			exits. Leaving system hooks installed will slow message processing for all 
			applications on the system at best. It could even cause one or more processes 
			to become unstable. To put it in more technical terms that speaks to the 
			developer in all of us: It's really really bad to forget this part. So be sure 
			to remove your system hooks when you are done with them. We ensure that we 
			remove the system hooks in our sample application by adding a <code>Dispose</code>
			call in the form's <code>Dispose</code> method.</P>
		<pre>    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (disposing)
        {
            if (mouseHook != null)
            {
                mouseHook.Dispose();
                mouseHook = null;
            }
        
            // ...
        }
    }</pre>
		<P>That's all there is to using the class library. It comes with two system hook 
			classes and is easily extendable.</P>
		<H2>Building The Library</H2>
		<P>
		There are two major components of the library. The first part is a C# class 
		library which you use directly in your application. That class library, in 
		turn, uses an unmanaged C++ DLL internally to manage the system hooks directly. 
		We'll first discuss developing the C++ part. Next we'll cover how to use this 
		library in C# to build a general hooking class. As we discuss the C++ / C# 
		interaction, we'll pay particular attention to how the C++ methods and data 
		types map to .NET methods and data types.
		<P>
		You may be wondering why we need two libraries, especially an unmanaged C++ 
		DLL. You may have noticed also that two of the reference articles mentioned in 
		the background section of this article do not use any unmanaged code. To this I 
		say, "Exactly! That's why I'm writing this article." When you think about how 
		system hooks actually implement their functionality, it makes sense that we 
		need unmanaged code. In order for a global system hook to work, Windows inserts 
		your DLL into the process space of every running process. Since most processes 
		are not .NET processes they cannot execute .NET assemblies directly. We need an 
		unmanaged code stub which Windows can insert into all the processes that will 
		be hooked.
		<p>The first order of business is to provide a mechanism to pass a .NET delegate 
			into our C++ library. Thus we defined the following function (<code>SetUserHookCallback</code>) 
			and function pointer (<code>HookProc</code>) in C++.</p>
		<pre>    int SetUserHookCallback(HookProc userProc, UINT hookID)</pre>
		<pre>    typedef void (CALLBACK *HookProc)(int code, WPARAM w, LPARAM l)</pre>
		<P>The second parameter to <code>SetUserHookCallback</code> is the type of hook 
			that this function pointer is intended to be used with. Now we have to define 
			corresponding methods and delegates in C# to use this code. Here is how we map 
			this to C#.</P>
		<pre>    private static extern SetCallBackResults SetUserHookCallback(HookProcessedHandler hookCallback, HookTypes hookType)</pre>
		<pre>    protected delegate void HookProcessedHandler(int code, UIntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam)</pre>
		<pre>
    public enum HookTypes
    {
       JournalRecord         = 0,
       JournalPlayback       = 1,
       // ...
       KeyboardLL            = 13,
       MouseLL               = 14
    };
</pre>
		<P>First we import the <code>SetUserHookCallback</code> function as a static 
			external method of our abstract base hook class <code>SystemHook</code> using 
			the <code>DllImport</code> attribute. To accomplish this we have to map some 
			rather foreign data types. First we have to create a delegate to serve as our 
			function pointer. This is done by defining the <code>HookProcessHandler</code> as 
			above. We need a function which in C++ has the signature <code>(int, WPARAM, 
				LPARAM)</code>. In the Visual Studio.NET C++ compiler <code>int</code> is 
			the same as in C#. That is <code>int</code> is <code>Int32</code> in both C++ 
			and C#. This has not always been the case. Some compilers treat C++ int as <code>Int16</code>. 
			We're sticking with the Visual Studio.NET C++ compiler for this project so we 
			won't worry about other definitions due to compiler differences. Finally, we 
			have defined the <code>HookTypes</code> enumeration by explicitly setting the 
			enumeration values to the same ones defining the C++ equivalents of the hook 
			types. These C++ definitions are located in the winuser.h header file.</P>
		<P>Next we need to pass <code>WPARAM</code> and <code>LPARAM</code> values around 
			in C#. These are really pointers to C++ <code>UINT</code> and <code>LONG</code> 
			values respectively. In C# speak, that's pointers to <code>uint</code> and <code>int</code>. 
			In case you're not sure what a <code>WPARAM</code> is, you can simply look it 
			up where it is defined by right clicking in the C++ code and choosing "Go to 
			definition". That takes you to this definition in windef.h.</P>
		<pre>   // From windef.h:
   typedef UINT_PTR            WPARAM;
   typedef LONG_PTR            LPARAM;
</pre>
		<P>Therefore we chose <code>System.UIntPtr</code> and <code>System.IntPtr</code> as 
			our variable types for the <code>WPARAM</code> and <code>LPARAM</code> types 
			when they get to C#.</P>
		<P>Now let's see how the hook base class uses these imported methods to pass a 
			callback function (delegate) to C++ which allows the C++ library to directly 
			call into your system hook class instance. First, in the constructor, the <code>SystemHook</code>
			class creates a delegate to the private method <code>InternalHookCallback</code>
			which matches the <code>HookProcessedHandler</code> delegate signature. Then it 
			passes this delegate and its <code>HookType</code> to the C++ library to 
			register the callback using the <code>SetUserHookCallback</code> method as 
			discussed above. Here it is in code.</P>
		<pre>public SystemHook(HookTypes type, IntPtr appInstance)
{
   this.appInstance = appInstance;
   this.type = type;

   processHandler = new HookProcessedHandler(InternalHookCallback);
   SetUserHookCallback(processHandler, this.type);
}</pre>
		<p>The implementation of <code>InternalHookCallback</code> is quite simple. <code>InternalHookCallback</code>
			just passes the call to the abstract method <code>HookCallback</code> while 
			wrapping it in a catch-all <code>try/catch</code> block. This simplifies the 
			implementation in the derived classes and guards the C++ code from uncaught 
			.NET exceptions. Remember, once everything is wired up the C++ hook will be 
			calling this method directly.</p>
		<pre>[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private void InternalHookCallback(int code, UIntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam)
{
   try
   {
      HookCallback(code, wparam, lparam);
   }
   catch {}
}
</pre>
		<P>We have added a method implementation attribute which tells the compiler to not 
			inline this method. This is not optional. At least it was required before I 
			added the <code>try/catch</code>. It seems that for some reason the compiler 
			was attempting to inline this method which caused all sorts of trouble with the 
			delegate that was wrapping it. The C++ layer would then call back and the 
			method would be gone.</P>
		<P>Now, let's look at how a derived class with a specific <code>HookType</code> receives 
			and processes hook events. Here is the virtual <code>HookCallback</code> method 
			implementation for the <code>MouseHook</code> class.
		</P>
		<pre>   protected override void HookCallback(int code, UIntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam)
   {
      if (MouseEvent == null)
      {
         return;
      }
      
      int x = 0, y = 0;
      MouseEvents mEvent = (MouseEvents)wparam.ToUInt32();

      switch(mEvent)
      {
         case MouseEvents.LeftButtonDown:
            GetMousePosition(wparam, lparam, ref x, ref y);
            break;
         // ...
      }

      MouseEvent(mEvent, new Point(x, y));
   }</pre>
		<P>First, note that this class defines an event <code>MouseEvent</code> which it 
			fires whenever it receives a hook event. This class transforms the data from <code>WPARAM</code>
			and <code>LPARAM</code> types to data meaningful for mouse events in .NET 
			before firing its event. That saves the consumers of the class from having to 
			worry about interpreting these data structures. This class uses the imported <code>GetMousePosition</code>
			function that we have defined in the C++ DLL to convert these values. See the 
			discussion a few paragraphs below for more details on this.</P>
		<P>In this method, we check that someone is actually listening to the event. If 
			not, there is no reason to continue processing the event. Then we convert our <code>
				WPARAM</code> to a <code>MouseEvents</code> enumeration type. We have 
			carefully constructed the <code>MouseEvents</code> enumeration to exactly match 
			the constants they mirror in C++ by value. This allows us to simply cast the 
			pointer's value to the enumerated type. Be careful though, this cast will 
			succeed even if the value of the <code>WPARAM</code> does not match an 
			enumerated value. The value of <code>mEvent</code> will simply be undefined 
			(not <code>null</code>, just not one of the enumeration values). See the method <code>
				System.Enum.IsDefined</code> for details on this.</P>
		<P>Next after determining the type of event we have received, the class fires the 
			event and the consumer is notified of the type of mouse event and the location 
			of the mouse during that event.</P>
		<P>A final note about converting the <code>WPARAM</code> and <code>LPARAM</code>
			values: For each type of event, the values and meanings of these variables are 
			different. Therefore in each hook type, we must interpret the values 
			differently. I chose to perform this conversion in C++ rather than trying to 
			mimic complex C++ structures and pointers in C#. For example, the previous 
			class used a C++ function called <code>GetMousePosition</code>. Here's that 
			method from the C++ DLL.</P>
		<pre>   bool GetMousePosition(WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam, int &amp; x, int &amp; y)
   {
      MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT * pMouseStruct = (MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT *)lparam;
      x = pMouseStruct-&gt;pt.x;
      y = pMouseStruct-&gt;pt.y;

      return true;
   }
			</pre>
		<P>Rather than attempting to map the <code>MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT</code> structure pointer 
			to C#, we simply pass it back to the C++ layer temporarily to extract the 
			values we need. Note that because we need to return several values from this 
			call we passed our integers as reference variables. This directly maps to <code>int 
				*</code> in C#. But we can override this behavior by selecting the right 
			signature to import this method.</P>
		<pre>   private static extern bool InternalGetMousePosition(UIntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam, ref int x, ref int y)</pre>
		<P>By defining the integer parameters as <code>ref int</code> we get our values 
			passed by reference to C++. We could have also used <code>out int</code> if we 
			wanted.</P>
		<H2>Extras</H2>
		<P><STRONG>Library Documentation</STRONG>: We have included fairly thorough code 
			documentation with the ManagedHooks class library. This is converted to 
			standard help XML via Visual Studio.NET when compiling in the "Documentation" 
			build configuration. Finally we have used <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/wiki">
				NDoc</a> to convert this to Compiled HTML Help (CHM). This help file is 
			available simply by clicking the "Managed Hooks.chm" file in the Solution 
			Explorer of the solution or by looking in the downloadable ZIP files associated 
			with this article.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Enhanced Intellisense</STRONG>: In case you are not familiar with how 
			Visual Studio.NET uses the compiled XML file (pre-NDoc output) for enhancing 
			intellisense for projects that reference libraries, let me say something about 
			that here. If you decide to use this class library in your applications, you 
			might consider copying a stable build of the library to a location where you 
			will reference it. Then also copy the XML documentation file 
			(SystemHooks\ManagedHooks\bin\Debug\Kennedy.ManagedHooks.xml) to the same 
			location. When you add a reference to the library, Visual Studio.NET will 
			automatically read that file and use it to add intellisense documentation. This 
			is very helpful, especially for third party libraries such as this one.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Unit Tests</STRONG>: I believe all libraries should have unit 
			tests associated with them. Since I am a partner and software engineer in a
			company which makes unit testing software for .NET, this should come as no 
			surprise to anyone. Thus you will find a&nbsp;unit test project in the 
			solution entitled ManagedHooksTests. To run the unit tests, you will need 
			to download and install HarnessIt from
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.unittesting.com">http://www.unittesting.com</A></P>
		<P>This download is a free trial version of our commercial unit testing software.
		</P>
		<P> In the unit tests, I paid special attention to this where invalid arguments to 
			methods could end up causing C++ memory exceptions. Although this library is 
			fairly simple, the unit tests did help me discover a few bugs in the more
			subtle situations.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Unmanaged/Managed Debugging</STRONG>: One of the things that is tricky about 
			mixed solutions such as this one (managed and unmanaged code) is debugging. If 
			you want to be able to step into the C++ code or set break points in the C++ 
			code, you must enable unmanaged debugging. This is a project setting in Visual 
			Studio.NET. Note that you can step between the managed and unmanaged layers 
			very nicely, but unmanaged debugging does significantly slow the load time and 
			execution speed of the application while in the debugger.</P>
		<h2>A Final Warning</h2>
		<p>Let me paraphrase Dr. Seuss in the famous children's book <EM>Fox in Sox</EM> in 
			providing this final warning.</p>
		<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <STRONG>Take is slowly. These classes are dangerous.</STRONG></P>
		<P>System hooks are powerful. And, with that power comes responsibility. When 
			something goes wrong with system hooks, they don't just break your application. 
			They can break <STRONG>every</STRONG> application running on your system. It is 
			unlikely that it would actually come to that extreme. Nonetheless, you need to 
			double and triple check your code when using system hooks.</P>
